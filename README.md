# AI Analyst Agent using n8n, ChatGPT 40 Mini & OpenAI Embedding 3 Small

## Overview
This repository contains an AI-powered analyst agent built using **n8n**, **ChatGPT 40 Mini**, and **OpenAI Embedding 3 Small**. The agent processes files from **OneDrive**, converts them into **vector data**, and responds intelligently using embeddings. Users can leverage this AI chatbot for various analytical purposes such as **stock analysis, financial insights, data interpretation, and more**.

## Features
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Fetches files directly from OneDrive.
- **Vector Embedding Processing**: Converts extracted data into vectors using OpenAI Embedding 3 Small.
- **Conversational AI**: Uses ChatGPT 40 Mini to provide relevant insights based on embedded data.
- **Stock & Data Analysis**: Users can analyze stock trends, perform financial assessments, and obtain insights on uploaded datasets.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Built with n8n, making it highly flexible and easy to modify.

## Workflow Architecture
1. **File Input**: User uploads a file to OneDrive.
2. **Data Processing**:
   - The file is retrieved via **n8n** automation.
   - OpenAI Embedding 3 Small converts the file into vector data.
3. **AI Chatbot Processing**:
   - The vectorized data is passed to **ChatGPT 40 Mini**.
   - The AI agent responds with analysis, insights, or stock trends.
4. **User Interaction**: Users can query the agent for any analytical insights based on the uploaded file.

## n8n Workflow
The workflow in **n8n** consists of the following steps:
1. **Trigger**: Listens for new file uploads in OneDrive.
2. **File Retrieval**: Fetches the uploaded document.
3. **Preprocessing**: Converts the file into text format if necessary (e.g., extracting text from PDFs).
4. **Embedding Generation**: Uses OpenAI Embedding 3 Small to transform the text into vector representations.
5. **Chatbot Processing**: Sends the vectorized data to ChatGPT 40 Mini for generating analytical insights.
6. **Response Delivery**: Returns the generated insights to the user via n8n or a chat interface.
